Taylor's contributions, not yet merged to master:
* Correct infinite loop bug of i-type and j-type instructions. (Complete)
* Correct JALR instruction function. (Complete)
* Create Verilator testbench for verification purposes. (Complete)
* Add hex_gen support for remaining unsupported RISC-V instructions (In progress)
-----------------

Instructions to run a randomly generated risc-v instruction sequence on the simple CPU, and view waves forms with the Verilator/C++ testbench, useful for verification:

1. Generate libhex.so
2. Generate a set of instructions for the CPU to run
	* cd to hex_gen directory
	* Run make to create an executable.
	  * $ make
	* Run hex_gen executable within input to specify how many instructions you want. To generate 2 i-type instructions, 3 j-type instructions and 5 r-type instructions run:
	  * $ ./hex_gen -i 2 -j 3 -r 5
	* Copy the 2 output hex files into the verilator_testbench directory: test_instr.hex and test_pc.hex.

3. Run Verilator
	* cd to the verilator_testbench directory
	* Run verilate
  	  * $ make verilate
	* Run build
	  * $ make build
	* In Makefile, make sure the +test flag matches the .hex file names.  It will by default, but will need to be updated to match the hex files if a custom name was chosen.  Under .stamp.sim:
	+test=***UPDATE IF A CUSTOM TEST NAME WAS USED*** \
	* Run simulation.
	  * $ make sim
	* View waves. Will automatically open gtkwave and show waveforms.
	  * $ make waves

What is [SimpleCPU](https://simplecpu.github.io/)?
-----------------
SimpleCPU is a CPU design and verification platform with a bunch of design and verification tools under its hood. SimpleCPU is aimed towards students and researchers, helping them learn and easily carry out CPU simulations in an intuitive way. Being an open source project makes it easier for one to get an indepth understanding of the the underlying concepts by glossing at the source.

SimpleCPU focuses on the fundamentals. Everything has been written from scratch such as ALUs, multipliers, decoders etc. 

Our goal is to enable system-designers and researchers to rapidly evaluate new ideas in the field of processor design, memory hierarchy, cache design and other aspects involved in computer architecture research. We want to enable designers to quickly add the new module to  the existing RTL and the models and test the new solution effectively. Along with this, SimpleCPU organisation is also in contact with many of the universities to adopt SimpleCPU as part of the labs for Computer architecture courses. This would give students a great insight on the entire design and verification flow for system-on-chips.  

Brief Overview
--------------
SimpleCPU repository consists of three main parts:
  * CPU RTL and Testbench (written in Verilog/SystemVerilog)
  * Instruction Set Simulator (C-based fast CPU simulation model)
  * Hex Generator (C-based random instruction sequence (RIS) generator)

The CPU implementation is carried out in Verilog which is widely used across academia and industry as well. This CPU RTL is the design under test (DUT) which is verified by carrying out simulations under different random instruction sequence loads. But as the design gets vast and complicated there would be a need to add certain directed tests as well. SimpleCPU focuses on maintaining an intuitive way towards both RTL design and the verification aspects. For easy understanding of the Instruction Set Architecture, C-models were created. These help in understanding the behaviour of the different instructions and also help in verifying the RTL through SimpleCPU's co-simulation environment. The Instruction Set Simulator is therefore an important tool for carrying out RTL design and simulations. 
Since CPU verification requires that the CPU should work under all possible combinations of instructions available in the instruction set architecture, it becomes a daunting task to cover all these instructions. To avoid this we have written the Hex Generator tool from scratch and using basic C such that students find it more appealing. The tool generates random instruction sequences and dumps the hex value for every generated instruction - thus the name Hex Generator. 

Here's an example simulation of a single cycle 32-bit MIPS CPU running a random instruction sequence along with an instruction set simulator which helps in checking the RTL state as in when each instruction retires.

 ** Note: $finish    : testbench/top_tb.sv(94)

```

The entire simulation can be carried out by simply running the "run.pl" perl script. The script compiles the model version and dumps the .so file used by the simulator for C-DPI calls. If there aren't any errors during make, the HDL code is then compiled and simulated. From the above simulation log it is quite evident that both model and RTL are simulating the same set of instructions and as the instruction retires the values are compared to remove any differences between the two implementations. The simulation is finished once the testbench detects the "syscall" instruction with register R2 containing the value 10.

Installation
------------

## Linux

Download the Altera modelsim version (for linux) from their webiste:

https://www.altera.com/downloads/software/modelsim-starter/121.html

(Note: You need to be enrolled in a university to download this edition)

You can also download a reduced version of modelsim:
```
wget https://github.com/SimpleCPU/SimpleCPU/releases/download/v0.0.1/modelsim_reduced.tgz
```
Untar the tarball and set the path in the env variable:
```sh
tar -xvf modelsim_reduced.tgz
export PATH=$PATH:<Complete path to modelsim>/modelsim_reduced/linux
```

Note: The free version of modelsim supports 32-bit only. To install the dependent 32-bit libraries on a 64-bit linux machine:
```sh
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib \
lib32z1 lib32stdc++6 lib32gcc1 \
expat:i386 fontconfig:i386 libfreetype6:i386 libexpat1:i386 libc6:i386 libgtk-3-0:i386 \
libcanberra0:i386 libpng12-0:i386 libice6:i386 libsm6:i386 libncurses5:i386 zlib1g:i386 \
libx11-6:i386 libxau6:i386 libxdmcp6:i386 libxext6:i386 libxft2:i386 libxrender1:i386 \
libxt6:i386 libxtst6:i386
```

Get the latest perl module:
```sh
sudo apt-get install perl
```

Run the simulation (for single cycle MIPS CPU) - 
```
perl run.pl -test all_instr
```
The entire simulation is carried out by the "run.pl" perl script. The script first compiles the model version and dumps the .so file to be used by the simulator for C-DPI calls. If there aren't any errors during make, the HDL code is then compiled and simulated.

The SimpleCPU project has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) only. Though it shouldn't be hard to port the scripts for windows as well. We are working towards testing the project on windows environment as well.
